          <p className="text-xs text-whoop-white/80 leading-relaxed">
            WHOOP utilizes advanced algorithms to analyze data from millions of sleep cycles across its user base. This data-driven approach allows WHOOP to provide personalized sleep recommendations based on your unique patterns, strain levels, and recovery needs. By tracking all four sleep stages and applying sleep science research, WHOOP helps optimize your sleep quality to maximize performance and recovery.
